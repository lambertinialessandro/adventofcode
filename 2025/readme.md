# 📖 About

This repository contains my solutions and tools for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

Each problem is solved in Python, with a focus on:
- Clean, readable, and efficient code
- Algorithmic variety (DFS, A*, recursion, caching, regex, etc.)
- Performance benchmarking for each part

# 💬 Notes

- Execution times are measured locally (Python 3.12).
- Stars indicate completion:
    - ⭐ = solved
    - 🌗 = in progress
    - 🌑 = unsolved
- Some later puzzles will be revisited for optimization.
